# Employee Management System (EMS)

This is a simple Employee Management System built using React.  
The main goal of this project is to understand how role-based systems work in real applications.

In this system, an Admin can manage employees and assign tasks, while Employees can log in and see only their own tasks.  
This project is created for learning and practice purposes.
